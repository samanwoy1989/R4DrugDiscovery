# R and Bioconductor in Drug Discovery

This repository demonstrates how **R** and **Bioconductor** revolutionize drug discovery through workflows for omics analysis, harmonization of datasets, and custom visualizations. 

## Features
- Workflows for **genomics**, **transcriptomics**, **proteomics**, and **metabolomics**.
- Tools for data harmonization, meta-analysis, and biomarker discovery.
- Case studies linking bioinformatics to real-world drug discovery.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samanwoy1989/R4DrugDiscovery.git
   cd R4DrugDiscovery
